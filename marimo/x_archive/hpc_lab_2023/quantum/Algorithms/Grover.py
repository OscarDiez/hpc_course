        # Grover's Algorithm

        Grover's Algorithm is an algorithm to solve the unstructured search problem. That is, we have a function $f(x)$ where $f(x) = 1$ if $x$ is a solution, and $f(x) = 0$ if $x$ is not a solution.

        Classicaly, if the search space (i.e. possible $x$) has $N$ elements, we need $O(N)$ queries to discover the solution because no guarantees are made about $f(x)$.

        Grover's algorithm manages to solve the problem with $O(\sqrt N)$, despite not knowing nothing about $f(x)$. That quadratic speedup can be widely applied to many brute-force algorithms.

        In real life, the search problem might be:

        * Travelling salesman problem
        * Finding the password for an encrypted file
        * Boolean satisfiability problem

        In this notebook, we will solve the "Needle in a Haystack" problem: we will try to find a single solution string $s$ among a big search space.

        We will cover the 3 steps of Grover's algorithm:

        ### Step 1

        Generate the superposition state:

        $$
        |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2 ^ {n}}\sum_{x \in \{0, 1\}^{n}}|x\rangle
        $$

        And initialize the ancilla qubit to $\frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt 2}$.

        ### Step 2

        Apply Grover's iteration $K$ times:

        * Query the oracle. This is sometimes also called reflection around the solution.
        * Invert about the mean. This is sometimes also called reflection around the superposition state.

        ### Step 3

        Measure the qubits. $s$ will be the measurement with a high probability.

        ## Multi-qubit Toffoli gate

        To implement, the inversion about the mean, we need a Multi-qubit Toffoli gate. In Qiskit, that gate is available through:

        ```Python
        circuit.mct(controls, target, ancillas, mode)
        ```

        Notice that the mode influences how the circuit is built. For more information, read Qiskit's documentation. This time, we have opted to use the *noancilla* mode in order to have a circuit with no extra qubits. Notice that depending on the mode, more gates might be used (it is a trade-off after all).

        For the curious, here is what a multi-qubit Toffoli gate looks like when decomposed into CNOTs and single qubit gates.

        ## Querying the oracle

        To query the oracle, we need a working qubit to store $f(x)$. Thus, the oracle acts as $|x\rangle|0\rangle \rightarrow |x\rangle|f(x)\rangle$ and $|x\rangle|1\rangle \rightarrow |x\rangle|1 \oplus f(x)\rangle$.

        On this implementation, we have opted to choose to implement the "Needle in a Haystack" problem. That is, there is a single solution $s$ among a big search space.

        Mathematically, we will implement a function such that $f(x) = 1 \iff x = s$ and $f(x) = 0$ if $x \neq s$.

        To implement $f$, we will use a multi-controlled Toffoli gate. We will $NOT$ all the bits that are 0 in $s$, apply the Toffoli gate, and then $NOT$ again to reverse the change in $x$. That circuit implements $f(x)$ as we described before, because the AND is only true when $x = s$. The following code does exactly that:

        ## Inversion about the mean

        The inversion about the mean step is the crucial step in Grover's algorithm.

        The idea of inversion about the mean is to amplify the amplitude of the solution, and to minimize the amplitude of nonsolutions. It can be seen as a process distributing the amplitudes from nonsolutions to the solution.

        It is important to notice that at exactly $K$ Grover iterations, the solution's amplitude has reached its maximum value. Thus, if we apply more iterations, it starts to decrease. We can verify that computationally.

        Eventually, if more iterations are applied, the state will become $H^{\otimes n}|000...0\rangle$ again. Hence, it is important to find the right value of $K$, otherwise the probability of failing increases by a considerable margin.
